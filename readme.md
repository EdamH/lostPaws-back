# Lost Paws Back-end Server

## Description

This is the backend code for the mobile project for our group in INDP2-A, at SUP'COM

## Installation

`git clone project-url-provided-in-moodle`

## Usage

`npm run dev`

Then, you have to go over to the front and change the `url` variable under `endpoints.js` to the localhost address, if you are using your local machine.


**BE AWARE: If you wish to run this project on your own mobile device rather than a local virtual machine you must:**

1. Bring up the terminal.
2. Plug in the `ipconfig` command.
3. Look for your ipv4 address.
4. Plug it into the `url` variable in the frontend.
5. It should work now!
